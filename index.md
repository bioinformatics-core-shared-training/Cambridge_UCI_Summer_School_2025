#### Additional Bioinformatics resources:

* [Cheat sheets for the Tidyverse (and other packages)](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)  
    I can't stress enough how useful these are when you are learning R. To begin with download the sheets for:   
    * [dplyr](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf)   
    * [tidyr](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/tidyr.pdf)    
    * [stringr](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/strings.pdf) 
    * [ggplot2](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf)  

    Print them out and keep them nearby for reference whenever you are coding. - Ash
* [Differential gene expression analysis with bulk RNAseq data in R](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/Reverse_Summer_School_2024_RNAseq) - see below for R packages and data.
* [Summer School 2024 Precourse instructions](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/Reverse_Summer_School_2024_PreCourse/) - Includes instructions for installing packages and downloading data for the course above.
